# Password-Strength-Checker
Python program for checking password complexity
Password Strength Checker
This Python script evaluates the strength of a given password based on multiple criteria including length, character variety, and entropy. The script provides feedback to help improve the password's security.

Features
Checks password against the following criteria:
Minimum length of 8 characters
Inclusion of at least one uppercase letter
Inclusion of at least one lowercase letter
Inclusion of at least one numeric digit
Inclusion of at least one special character
Minimum entropy of 50 bits
Provides a score and feedback on how to improve the password strength.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Usage
You can use the script by providing a password as a command-line argument or by entering it interactively when prompted.

Command Line Argument
To check a password provided as a command-line argument, use the -p or --password option:

python password_strength_checker.py -p YourPasswordHere
Interactive Mode
If you do not provide a password as a command-line argument, the script will prompt you to enter a password interactively:

python password_checker.py
Example Output
Strong Password
$ python password_checker.py -p StrongP@ssw0rd!
Password Strength: Strong
Weak Password with Feedback
$ python password_checker.py -p weak
Password Strength: Weak
Feedback:
 - Password should be at least 8 characters long.
 - Password should include at least one uppercase letter.
 - Password should include at least one special character.
 - Password entropy is too low. Consider adding more unique characters.
